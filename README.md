# Structured-Document-Processing-
Work for structured document processing course

* Assignment 1 : The document type for a recipe collection must be defined in DTD or XSD, making in each case the best possible use of the expressive ability of the respective language.
  This document is a collection of recipes consisting of a header and arranged in a hierarchy. The elements of the hierarchy are the part, the section and the subsection, the first being the most general and the last the most specific.<br />
  A recipe is an annotated text that in addition to having fields like name, difficulty, calories, among others, also contains a list of ingredients and a list of steps to perform.<br />
  In the header must be present the title of the book, its author and the date of publication.
  
* Assignment 2 : Transform the collection-type documents previously defined with DTD and XSD. If necessary, changes can be made to these definitions in order to correct deficiencies or to facilitate the transformation process. These transformations have as main objective to complement the validation of the collection of recipes and also provide visualization to these.
  
* Assignment 3 : Creation of metadata referring to collections of recipes developed in previous works. The production of RDF-XML documents with the metadata must use an XSLT transformation on the respective XML document containing the collection of recipes.
